    "Machine learning is used by billions of people at almost every moment nowadays. In fact, it has been around for decades in specialized applications like optical character recognition (OCR). The first mainstream ML application that significantly improved lives was the spam filter in the 1990s. While not a self-aware robot, it effectively learned to identify spam, reducing the need for manual intervention. Since then, hundreds of ML applications have emerged, quietly powering features we use regularly, such as voice prompts, automatic translation, image search, and product recommendations.\"\n",

    "### Using Spam Filter as an example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Without Machine learning, you need to figure out the exact rules that can help you detect the spam emails. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With Machine Learning\n",
    "Due to the complexity of the problem, your program may end up as a long list of intricate rules, making it difficult to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a spam filter that uses machine learning techniques automatically identifies features that are strong indicators of spam by detecting unusually frequent patterns in spam emails compared to non-spam emails \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig2.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "New training data samples can be added through user feedback, allowing the machine learning model to learn from this data. Consequently, the model can be automatically updated without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig3.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure! Let's use the spam filter as an example to explain some key concepts of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Data Collection**\n",
    "For a spam filter, we need a large dataset of emails labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" This dataset is essential for training the model. This dataset is called the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Feature Extraction**\n",
    "Features are the pieces of information that the model uses to make decisions. In the case of a spam filter, features might include:\n",
    "- The presence of certain keywords (e.g., \"win,\" \"free,\" \"prize\")\n",
    "- The email's sender\n",
    "- The presence of links\n",
    "- The overall frequency of certain words\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Training the Model**\n",
    "The part of a machine learning system that learns and makes predictions is called a model. The training process involves feeding the labeled dataset into a machine learning model. The model uses this data to learn patterns and correlations between the features and the labels (spam or not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Algorithm Selection**\n",
    "For the machine learning model, there are various algorithms to choose from, such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, or neural networks. For simplicity, let's consider a Naive Bayes classifier, which is often used for spam filtering due to its efficiency and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Model Training**\n",
    "During training, the algorithm analyzes the features of each email and adjusts its internal parameters to improve its ability to classify emails correctly. For example, it might learn that emails containing the word \"win\" have a higher probability of being spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Evaluation**\n",
    "Once trained, the model is evaluated on a separate set of emails that it hasn't seen before (test set). Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess how well the model performs. For a spam filter, you want high precision (few false positives) and high recall (few false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Prediction**\n",
    "When a new email arrives, the trained model extracts its features and predicts whether it is spam or not. If the model is confident enough, it can automatically move the email to the spam folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Continuous Learning**\n",
    "Machine learning models can improve over time. The spam filter can continuously learn from new emails, especially those that users manually mark as spam or not spam. This process, known as online learning or incremental learning, helps the model stay up-to-date with evolving spam techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Flow:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of emails labeled as \"spam\" and \"not spam.\"\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Identify features like keywords, sender, and links.\n",
    "3. **Training the Model**: Use a Naive Bayes classifier to learn patterns from the dataset.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Test the model on a separate set of emails and measure its performance.\n",
    "5. **Prediction**: Apply the model to new emails to classify them as spam or not spam.\n",
    "6. **Continuous Learning**: Update the model with new user-labeled emails to improve its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these steps, you can see how a spam filter uses machine learning to effectively identify and filter out unwanted emails."

    "\n",
    "The resulting model may be quite useful in itself—for example, to repair damaged images or to erase unwanted objects from pictures. But more often than not, a model trained using self-supervised learning is not the final goal. You’ll usually want to tweak and fine-tune the model for a slightly different task—one that you actually care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that what you really want is to have a pet classification model: given a picture of any pet, it will tell you what species it belongs to. If you have a large dataset of unlabeled photos of pets, you can start by training an image-repairing model using self-supervised learning. Once it’s performing well, it should be able to distinguish different pet species: when it repairs an image of a cat whose face is masked, it must know not to add a dog’s face. Assuming your model’s architecture allows it (and most neural network architectures do), it is then possible to tweak the model so that it predicts pet species instead of repairing images. The final step consists of fine-tuning the model on a labeled dataset: the model already knows what cats, dogs, and other pet species look like, so this step is only needed so the model can learn the mapping between the species it already knows and the labels we expect from it."
