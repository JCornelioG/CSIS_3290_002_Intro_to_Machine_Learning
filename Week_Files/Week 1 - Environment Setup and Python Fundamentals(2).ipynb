    "4. If you lack technical expertise and struggle with basic computer proficiency, it's essential to take proactive steps to improve as soon as possible. Start by learning basic tasks such as file compression, decompression, and file saving. These fundamental skills are essential prerequisites for this course.\n",
    "5. Do some research before posing technical inquiries. I encourage you to harness the power of AI and the vast resources available on the Internet to deepen the understanding of concepts. Being proficient in data science isn't just about memorizing every tool or command; it's about mastering the skill of efficiently finding the information you're unfamiliar with. In my view, honing this ability is even more critical than the course material itself."

    "## IPython and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The [IPython project](https://ipython.org/) began in 2001 as Fernando Pérez’s side project to make a better interactive Python interpreter. Over the subsequent 20 years it has become one of the most important tools in the modern Python data stack. While it does not provide any computational or data analytical tools by itself, IPython is designed for both interactive computing and software development work. It encourages an execute-explore workflow instead of the typical edit-compile-run workflow of many other programming languages. It also provides integrated access to your operating system’s shell and filesystem; this reduces the need to switch between a terminal window and a Python session in many cases. Since much of data analysis coding involves exploration, trial and error, and iteration, IPython can help you get the job done faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Fernando and the IPython team announced the [Jupyter project](https://jupyter.org/), a broader initiative to design language-agnostic interactive computing tools. The IPython web notebook became the Jupyter notebook, with support now for over 40 programming languages. The IPython system can now be used as a kernel (a programming language mode) for using Python with Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython itself has become a component of the much broader Jupyter open source project, which provides a productive environment for interactive and exploratory computing. Its oldest and simplest \"mode\" is as an enhanced Python shell designed to accelerate the writing, testing, and debugging of Python code. You can also use the IPython system through the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook system also allows you to author content in Markdown and HTML, providing you a means to create rich documents with code and text."

    "## How to launch the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell, and builds on it a rich set of dynamic display capabilities.\n",
    "As well as executing Python/IPython statements, notebooks allow the user to include formatted text, static and dynamic visualizations, mathematical equations, JavaScript widgets, and much more.\n",
    "Furthermore, these documents can be saved in a way that lets other people open them and execute the code on their own systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though you'll view and edit Jupyter notebooks through your web browser window, they must connect to a running Python process in order to execute code.\n",
    "You can start this process (known as a \"kernel\") by running the following command in your system shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will launch a local web server that will be visible to your browser.\n",

    "## Magic Commands in IPython or Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "We have something called *magic commands*, and are prefixed by the `%` character. These magic commands are designed to succinctly solve various common problems in standard data analysis. Magic commands come in two flavors: *line magics*, which are denoted by a single `%` prefix and operate on a single line of input, and *cell magics*, which are denoted by a double `%%` prefix and operate on multiple lines of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running External Code: %run\n",
    "As you begin developing more extensive code, you will likely find yourself working in IPython for interactive exploration, as well as a text editor to store code that you want to reuse.\n",
    "Rather than running this code in a new window, it can be convenient to run it within your IPython session.\n",
    "This can be done with the `%run` magic command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you've created a *myscript.py* file with the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file: myscript.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"square a number\"\"\"\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "for N in range(1, 4):\n",
    "    print(f\"{N} squared is {square(N)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute this from your IPython session as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [6]: %run myscript.py\n",
    "1 squared is 1\n",
    "2 squared is 4\n",
    "3 squared is 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that after you've run this script, any functions defined within it are available for use in your IPython session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [7]: square(5)\n",
    "Out[7]: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options to fine-tune how your code is run; you can see the documentation in the normal way, by typing **`%run?`** in the IPython interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timing Code Execution: %timeit\n",
    "Another example of a useful magic function is `%timeit`, which will automatically determine the execution time of the single-line Python statement that follows it.\n",
    "For example, we may want to check the performance of a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [8]: %timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in range(1000)]\n",
    "430 µs ± 3.21 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of `%timeit` is that for short commands it will automatically perform multiple runs in order to attain more robust results.\n",
    "For multiline statements, adding a second `%` sign will turn this into a cell magic that can handle multiple lines of input.\n",
    "For example, here's the equivalent construction with a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [9]: %%timeit\n",
    "   ...: L = []\n",
    "   ...: for n in range(1000):\n",
    "   ...:     L.append(n ** 2)\n",
    "   ...: \n",
    "484 µs ± 5.67 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can immediately see that list comprehensions are about 10% faster than the equivalent `for` loop construction in this case."
